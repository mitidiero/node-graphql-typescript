# node-typescript
This is an experiment I've made using TypeScript, Node.js and GraphQl. I've used https://www.howtographql.com/ and https://dev.to/oieduardorabelo/nodejs-with-typescript-debug-inside-vscode-and-nodemon-23o7 as the base for this.

## Prisma
You can follow the instructions here to use Prisma, or just leave it as it is for now.

## Debugging

After starting the app with `npm run dev:debug`, you've two options:

1. For in-editor debug with VSCode, configuration already included in `.vscode/launch.json`. It will attach the debbuger to the running process.
2. You can look at `chrome://inspect` to open a debugger panel using Google Chrome DevTools.

## Screenshots

- Starting the app with `npm run dev:debug`
